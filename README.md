Noughts and Crosses with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Introduction:

Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) is a well-known two-player game. This project implements an AI-powered version using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to ensure the best possible moves while optimizing computational efficiency.

Features

Unbeatable AI: The AI always plays optimally using Minimax.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Improves efficiency by reducing unnecessary calculations.
Player vs. AI Mode: Play against the AI via the command line.
Move Evaluation: AI predicts the best moves for victory.

How to Play

The game starts with an empty 3x3 board.
The AI (X) always plays first.
The player (O) is prompted to input their move (row and column index: 0-2).
The game continues until a winner is found or the board is full (draw).

Future Improvements

Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better gameplay experience.
Add different difficulty levels for a more challenging AI.
Extend to larger boards (4x4, 5x5) for complex variations.
